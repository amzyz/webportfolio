# webportfolio
 I want to highlight my various coding projects, graphic designs, and some writing samples along with the soundscape and visual argument from class. I also want to add some personal flair to it by incorporating my live list of favorite articles and books to add some personality. I intend for prospective employers and colleagues to be the siteâ€™s primary audience, and I imagine they encounter the site through googling my name or finding it through Linkedin, as I plan to attach it to my Linkedin profile. I would definitely want to expand on it past its submission for class, as it is a live website documenting my personal and professional development. I want to convey that I am a person with interdisciplinary skills and interests that are reflected in my areas of study- Computer Science, Information Science, and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design. Particularly, I want to convey that I am well-versed in problem solving and algorithmic thinking, business-oriented digital solutions, creative user experience and interfacing, and english writing. I think a gorgeously designed website that is pleasing to the eye, has cool animations, and some symbolism that shows I like combining art and technology would be design choices to consider.
